# Chat Application

**This application contains these common files:**

- `package.json` - Points to the app's main file and lists its details and dependencies.
- `config.json` - Points to the app's config file.
- `main.js` - Starts the app and creates a browser window to render HTML. This is the app's **main process**.
- `index.html` - A web page to render. This is the app's **renderer process**.

You can learn more about each of these components within the [Quick Start Guide](http://electron.atom.io/docs/tutorial/quick-start).
